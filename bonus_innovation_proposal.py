# Bonus Task: Innovation Challenge
# Proposal: AI-Powered Automated Documentation Generator

proposal = '''
Purpose:
To automatically generate comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for software projects by analyzing codebases, extracting function/class signatures, and producing human-readable explanations.

Workflow:
1. Scan the codebase to identify functions, classes, and modules.
2. Use AI models to generate docstrings and markdown documentation based on code context and comments.
3. Aggregate generated documentation into structured files (e.g., README, API docs).
4. Continuously update documentation as code evolves.

Impact:
This tool saves developer time, improves code maintainability, and ensures that documentation remains current. It lowers onboarding barriers for new team members and enhances collaboration by making codebases more accessible and understandable.
